# minimal-webgpu-triangle
Minimal WebGPU triangle that works as of May 2022 and is readable (single-file JS like morzel85's earlier [work]([url](https://github.com/morzel85/webgpu-wgsl-hello-triangle )))

As of the making of this (May 27, 2022), I found no example that actually worked, was using only web standard technologies (ie. no unrelated TS+React+Webpack tooling) and was somewhat readable.
Used Chrome Canary, needed to enable `chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`

Working version: https://codepen.io/monfera/pen/VwQyNWv

Should show a triangle:
